    \title Upload Packages to the Deployment Server

Currently there are three possible ways to upload packages to the Deployment Server: using admin page
in web interface, using command line tool on the host where the server runs, and using REST API of the
server itself.

\section1 Through Server Admin Page

This was the first uploading method implemented. It uses django admin page, accessible by \c{/admin/} URL of
the Deployment Server.

To add application:
\list
  \li Navigate to the URL specified above
  \li Login there as a user with administrative rights
  \li Go to Apps section of the Store
  \li Press \uicontrol{Add app} button.
\endlist

At this point, there will be form to add an application, containing the following fields: file, vendor, category,
brief description, and description.

\table
  \header
    \li Field
    \li Field description
  \row
    \li File
    \li Where the package file for upload is specified.
  \row
    \li Vendor
    \li The package vendor. When package signing is enabled, vendor's certificate is used
    to add package signature. When package signing is disabled, it is still required, but has no
    real effect.
  \row
    \li Category
    \li Category, in which a package will be shown on the deployment server. Currently it is
    possible to select only one category, even if specification allows multiple categories to be
    specified in a package file metadata.
  \row
    \li Description
    \li {1,2} BriefDescription and Description fields are self-explanatory (and they will be
    returned as-is in the related API requests).
  \row
    \li BriefDescription
\endtable

After filling in the fields and pressing \uicontrol{save} button, the package will be added to the
deployment server or error message will be reported.


\section1 Through API

It requires making POST request to \c{/upload} URL. Parameters are described on
\l{Qt Automotive Suite Deployment Server API Reference} page.

\section1 Through Command Line Tool

If it is possible to access the command line of the Deployment Server, this is preferable way to
upload packages. The tool is a \c{store-upload-package} implemented as a part of \c{manage.py}
django main program. The tool can be run with the following command line:
\code
manage.py store-upload-package --vendor <vendor> --category <category> [--description <short description>] <package>
\endcode
Vendor and category are specified as their name, not an ID in django database. Description and brief
description are filled with the same value by this tool.
